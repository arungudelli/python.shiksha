To contribute to DS & algo problems 

1. Add a new mark down file `(.md)` file with the issue name, For example `two-sum-problem.md` inside `content/en/problems/` folder.
2. Start the file with the below HUGO markup 
3. And starting with the problem statement explain the different ways to solve the problem in Python.
4. Starting with brute force method to optimal solution mention time complexity and space complexity if applicable.

Here is the template of the file
